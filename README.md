# AutomatedRegressionTesting (POC)

---

Replicated an automated regression testing program to demonstrate proficiency
in Java, Maven, TestNG, and Selenium. Used TestNG to organize and structure tests, and Selenium WebDriver to interact
with the browser. Validated UI workflows by capturing and asserting UI elements in sequence. Configured the system
to read test cases from an external Excel sheet and generate a log of completed tests
